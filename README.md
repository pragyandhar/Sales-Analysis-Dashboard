# 📊 NovaMart Superstore Sales Dashboard

**"The Superstore That Couldn’t Scale" — A Data Analyst’s Dive into Hidden Profit Leaks**

Welcome to the Power BI Dashboard that uncovers how a booming superstore was **silently bleeding profits** despite increasing sales. In this project, we play the role of a data detective — cutting through noise, cracking patterns, and delivering **actionable insights**.

## 🧠 THE DATA STORY

Once upon a spreadsheet, NovaMart was thriving with booming orders and happy customers. Yet, something wasn’t right — **profits were vanishing**. That’s when the data analyst (you) stepped in...

🔍 You didn’t just build charts —  
You solved a **business mystery**.
